I'm a physics professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (https://rfisher.sites.umassd.edu/). I do computational astrophysics, with a particular focus on multidimensional hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations, combustion, and thermonuclear transients. This repository is a collection of my public work, including:

* Code snippets and scripts from my research, particularly related to the FLASH code (such as FLASH-X Docker, https://github.com/rtfisher/flashx_docker) and SNID Docker (https://github.com/rtfisher/snid_docker)
* Research lecture notes, such as from a summer school at ICESUN in Yunnan Province, China https://github.com/rtfisher/summerschool_lectures.
* Visualizations used in my classes --
  * My sophomore-level astrophysics class for physics majors and interested non-majors:  exoplanet transit visualizer (https://github.com/rtfisher/exoplanet-transit-visualization)
  * My sophomore-level modern physics class: photoelectric effect (https://github.com/rtfisher/photoelectric-animation)
  * My junior-level undergraduate physics major class, illustrating forced, damped, harmonic and anharmonic oscillators (https://github.com/rtfisher/forced_damped_oscillator), normal modes of coupled harmonic oscillators (https://github.com/rtfisher/normal_modes), the restricted three body problem (https://github.com/rtfisher/circular_restricted_three_body_problem), torque-free rotation of a rigid body (https://github.com/rtfisher/torque-free-rigid-rotation), and the Poinsot ellipsoid construction for rotating bodies (https://github.com/rtfisher/poinsot_ellipsoids).
* Anything else I'm excited to share -- including a grant budget calculator (https://github.com/rtfisher/grant-budget-calculator), or  a Python script which reads PDFs of student transcripts and streamlines the degree certification process (https://github.com/rtfisher/degree-certify).  Not astrophysical but very convenient time savers!

Feel free to poke around and see what's new. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
