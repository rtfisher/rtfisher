## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About Me
I'm a physics professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (https://rfisher.sites.umassd.edu/). I am a computational astrophysicist with a particular focus on multidimensional hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations, combustion, and thermonuclear transients. This repository is a collection of my public work, including:

* Code snippets and scripts from my research, particularly related to the FLASH code
* Small personal projects
* Anything else I'm excited to share!

Feel free to poke around and see what's new. If you have any questions or just want to connect, don't hesitate to reach out!

Continuing a legacy that traces back through Lyman Spitzer, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, and Carl Friedrich Gauss

"We are all made of star stuff" â€“ and stellar explosions! âœ¨
