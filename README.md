I'm a physics professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (https://rfisher.sites.umassd.edu/). I do computational astrophysics, with a particular focus on multidimensional hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations, combustion, and thermonuclear transients. This repository is a collection of my public work, including:

* Code snippets and scripts from my research, particularly related to the FLASH code (such as FLASH-X Docker, https://github.com/rtfisher/flashx_docker and SNID Docker, https://github.com/rtfisher/snid_docker)
* Visualizations used in my classes -- most notably from my junior-level undergraduate physics major class, illustrating forced, damped, harmonic and anharmonic oscillators (https://github.com/rtfisher/forced_damped_oscillator), normal modes of coupled harmonic oscillators (https://github.com/rtfisher/normal_modes), and torque-free rotation of a rigid body (https://github.com/rtfisher/torque-free-rigid-rotation)
* Other course materials and lecture notes (such as from a summer school in Yunnan Province, China https://github.com/rtfisher/summerschool_lectures)
* Anything else I'm excited to share (such as Degree Certify, https://github.com/rtfisher/degree-certify, a Python script which reads PDFs of student transcripts and streamlines the degree certification process. Not astrophysical but a very convenient time saver!)

Feel free to poke around and see what's new. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
